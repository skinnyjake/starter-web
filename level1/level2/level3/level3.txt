Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.

When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right?
